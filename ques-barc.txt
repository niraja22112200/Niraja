@Qualifier and few scenario based question here
git cherry-pick command uses 
programmatic : there is mix array list of  decimal numbers and integers , filter all the decimal and round it  to next integer number


Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]


Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], 

newInterval = [4,8]

Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].

get index when sum of two numbers will be 9

[2,7,5,11 ]  9

List<Integers> alist = Arrays.asList{2,7,5,11};

public class TestApp {

    public static void main (String [] args){
        List<Integer> alist = Arrays.asList(2,7,5,11);
        for (int i =0 ; i < alist.size(); i++){
            for (int j = i+1 ;  j <alist.size(); j++ ){
                if (alist.get(i) + alist.get(j) == 9 && i!=j ){
                    System.out.println("Required Index :"+ i + "" +j);
                   // return i + "" +j;
                    break;

                }else{
                    System.out.println("Required Index not present" );
                }
            }

        }
